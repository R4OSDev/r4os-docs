R4OS Audio
==========

R4AUDIO is the public platform group for PCM streams, hardware status and
synthesizer access. Applications request it through `module.R4MF` and use the
SDK facade; optional functions are guarded with `hasFn`.

Hardware output is provided by loadable R4D drivers such as AC97 and HDA.
SID, MIDI and OPL3 are separate driver/protocol components. The kernel keeps
only the common timing, routing and backend mechanisms required by the
platform contract.

The normal ownership chain is:

```text
R4X application -> R4AUDIO -> audio service/core -> active R4D backend
```

Drivers advertise capabilities and own hardware-specific conversion,
DMA, interrupts, stop and recovery. Applications must use the announced
stream format and close every stream they open.

Synth engines render productively into the common 48 kHz, stereo, signed
16-bit little-endian PCM path. A render request contains 1 to 1024 frames;
the audio core writes the complete block to the active R4D backend. Backend
backpressure is returned to the caller and preserves the same pending block
for retry. An explicitly requested synth name is exact: event-only engines
such as MIDI.R4D are not accepted as renderers, while OPL3.R4D supplies the
normal MIDI PCM implementation.

SID.R4D owns its emulation state and reaches the installed AudioSid.R4P
through DriverApi v18 protocol dispatch. SID frame rendering uses the same
backend and retry rules; protocol, runtime and backend failures remain
visible to applications instead of being converted into success.

The generic subsystem runtime uses the application audio facade rather than
a direct kernel path. Its default transport is 48 kHz stereo signed 16-bit
little endian in 480-frame quanta with caller-owned buffering. It opens no
service/backend stream until the first non-silent quantum. Empty, silent,
paused and muted cycles submit no full zero payload; an active sink is closed
once and may be materialized again by later signal. If the service or stream
fails, audio becomes degraded, clears its queued PCM once and leaves the audio
deadline schedule; guest time and video continue at their normal paced rate
without repeated PCM generation, scratch submission or a zero-wait loop.

HDA and AC97 submit refill/status/recovery passes through DriverApi v20. Each
request declares a 10 ms absolute deadline, a bounded callback budget and a
stable device key. A separate EDF queue and one `r4d-audio` short-completion
worker isolate those passes from normal Driver Work while globally
serializing them. Normal admission reserves deadline capacity and the
scheduler demotes the worker after its four-tick/four-dispatch boost, so audio
cannot form an unbounded priority lane. The current HDA and AC97 DMA geometry
is intentionally unchanged: the available cursor, queue, underrun and
deadline evidence did not justify a period or segment-DMA change.

PCM clients retain frame-aligned progress reported before Busy, timeout or a
hard error. R4Synth sends matching stereo S16LE WAV data directly and paces
only accepted frames after a 160-ms prefill. Beep uses 960-frame, 3840-byte
single-request blocks; its ten-block self-test reaches the HDA start window
and represents a complete 200-ms short tone.

Current modules are listed in `Docs/Inventory/AllModules.json`; diagnostics
and their tests are listed in the corresponding inventories.

The current HDA stream geometry, ownership, IRQ and lifecycle rules are in
`Docs/Drivers/HdaStreamContract.txt`. `AudioDiagnostics.txt` documents the
deterministic AudioDiag patterns, QEMU WAV analysis and 60-second ring test.
